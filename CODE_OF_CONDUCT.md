# MLSA KIIT Hacktoberfest: Stable Diffusion Fine-tuning Project Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

As members, contributors, and leaders of the MLSA KIIT community, we pledge to make participation in our Stable Diffusion fine-tuning project a positive and enriching experience for everyone. We aim to create an environment that fosters learning, innovation, and collaboration in the field of AI and machine learning.

## Our Standards

Behaviors that contribute to a positive environment for our community include:

* Sharing knowledge and assisting others in understanding Stable Diffusion and LoRA techniques
* Respecting diverse approaches to model fine-tuning and image generation
* Providing constructive feedback on others' fine-tuning results and generated images
* Being open to learning from others' implementations and ideas
* Focusing on the technical aspects of the project and maintaining a professional atmosphere

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* Using inappropriate language or imagery in code, documentation, or project communications
* Trolling, insulting comments, or personal attacks, particularly regarding fine-tuning choices or results
* Sharing or using datasets or generating images that could be considered harmful or unethical
* Publishing others' private information, such as contact details or private model weights, without permission
* Any conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in an academic or professional setting

## Project-Specific Guidelines

1. Dataset Usage: Ensure you have the right to use and share any datasets used for fine-tuning.
2. Image Generation: Be mindful of the content you generate. Avoid creating or sharing inappropriate or offensive images.
3. Model Sharing: Only share LoRA weights, not entire fine-tuned models, to respect project guidelines.
4. Collaboration: Be open to collaboration and knowledge sharing about Stable Diffusion and LoRA techniques.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces related to the MLSA KIIT Hacktoberfest Stable Diffusion fine-tuning project, including GitHub repositories, discussion forums, and any project-related events.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the MLSA KIIT team responsible for enforcement at [MLSA KIIT Discord](https://discord.gg/DymVbhCmJf). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

## Enforcement Guidelines

MLSA KIIT community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

1. Correction: A private, written warning, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate.

2. Warning: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved for a specified period of time.

3. Temporary Ban: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time.

4. Permanent Ban: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the project community.
